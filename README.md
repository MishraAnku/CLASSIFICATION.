# CLASSIFICATION

1.	PROJECT TITLE
IPHONE PURCHASE RECORDS 
2.	TASK 
PERFORMED CLASSIFICATION ON THE DATASET 
3.	LIBRARIES USED 
PYTHON LIBRARIES LIKE PANDAS , NUMPY  , MATPLOTLIB , SEABORN .
4.	CONCLUSION 
From the results, we can see that KNN and Kernel SVM have done better than the others for this particular dataset. So, we will shortlist these two for this project. This is precisely the same result that we arrived at by independently applying each of those algorithms.
